"I am colored Can read my mind, I'm defined, I'm just beginning, The pen's in my hand, Ending unplanned. Staring at the blank page before you, Open up the dirty window, Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find, Reaching for something in the distance, So close you can almost taste it, Release your inhibitions, Feel the rain on your skin."
